# Automatic Mailing
This is a personal project to automate the mailing after an event with my youth movement.
I organized an event where all the leaders were put into groups of four to raise money. 
Each team would walk and search for people who sponsored them for each kilometer they walked. 
Afterwards, we needed to mail over 100 people as soon as possible to tell them how much they should pay. I wanted to do this in an automated way, so that's why I wrote this code.
